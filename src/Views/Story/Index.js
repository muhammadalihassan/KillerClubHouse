               <h4>The first of many mistakes I would make.</h4>
               <p>As if driving on a dark desolate road wasn’t bad enough, the storm picked up to a point I lose all visibility. Suddenly a tree branch falls in the road and I barely manage to bring my SUV to an abrupt stop. With no way of continuing, I pull up my GPS to find an alternate route, only to realize I have lost all internet. With no other option but to turn around, I come up to a detour sign that I don’t remember seeing previously. This trip had been exhausting to this point and it had been a long day. I’m just ready to get to the creek, so I say screw it and take the detour.  </p>
               <p>About 20 mins into the drive, in pitch-black darkness, my rear tire blows causing me to almost lose control. Overcorrecting my steering wheel, I manage to pull over and turn my hazard lights on. I grab my flashlight from under the seat and walk back to the hatch, and realize my spare tire is missing. </p>
               <p>Chills begin to run down my spine with the thought of how many horror movies I have seen that started this way! Scared to my core, I caught a glimpse in my mind of how it could all end! I decide to Sit in my vehicle, smoking a fat bowl so I can ease my mind. I start to make out a beacon of light in the distance, and I think could this be a miracle? I can make out a house in the distance not too far from me. Feeling Stoned and anxious, I grab my flashlight, and tire iron, and start walking.</p>
               <p>As I get closer and closer, the light suddenly disappears and I am left with frequent lightning strikes to guide me. After walking for what seemed like an eternity, My eyes behold a 2-story gothic-style mansion. Bewildered, I thought to myself what are the freaking odds? I continue on through the dead bushes, trying my best to keep the thorns from taking over me. </p>
               <p>I had finally arrived somewhere I could ride the storm out at. I’m completely soaked and covered in mud. Thorns cover me for head to toe. At this moment, I was captivated by a bright light. Could this be what got my attention in the first place? Burst of green and blue rays appear in the distance, and what appeared to be a shadow I could only describe as being the Grim Reaper himself. Horrified, I turn and desperately run to the front door, dropping my tire iron in the process.I couldn't grasp how long it had taken me to get up here. Time seemed Illusive at this point.I knocked on the door repeatedly and no answer. I gave it one more cop knock just to make sure no one was there. After no reply, I turn the handle and, surprisingly, its open.</p>
               <p>I enter this abandoned masterpiece and immediately a pound of dust falls on my head. Cobwebs cover my face. It seemed like the house had been abandoned for a very long time. I get hit with an overwhelming pungent smell, almost as if I had walked into a morgue. </p>
               <p>Taking 3 steps forward into the living room, bam, I slip and bust my butt on the freezing tile. Everything's covered in blood and fecal matter. I brace myself and realize the temperature has dropped so cold I can see my breath in front of me. I take a deep breath and look around. I see an old fireplace so I search for something I can burn.</p>
               <p>The batteries in my flashlight begin to flicker and die. As my flashlight is going out all I see is graffiti and old pics on the wall of strange paintings. In this very moment I’m experiencing something worse than terror, and decide I need to leave immediately. I reach the front door and it is locked shut. </p>
               <p>Cold, Afraid, and stoned, I must survive a night alone in The Killer Clubhouse.</p>
